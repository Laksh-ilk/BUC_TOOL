# Conversation Summary: Currency Conversion and Machine Rate Implementation

## Requirements Discussed
1. Currency Conversion:
   - Values stored in USD by default
   - Exchange rates available in database
   - Need to convert to target currency when displaying

2. Machine Rate Calculations:
   - Formulas provided for:
     - Depreciation
     - Maintenance
     - Space
     - Power
     - Water
     - Consumables
   - Multiple machine rates and process flows per item master
   - Factors affecting calculations included in formulas
   - Formulas stored in database

## Current Implementation Status
1. Frontend:
   - Machine rate calculations currently done in frontend
   - Country table has currency_symbol field
   - Machine rates stored in USD
   - Hardcoded values for:
     - Space cost: $0.05 per m²/hr
     - Water cost: $1.20 per m³
     - Power cost: Uses power_kw_hr and power_spec

2. Backend:
   - Need to create backend service
   - Need to add currency conversion rate field to country table
   - Need to move calculations to backend

## Proposed Implementation Plan
1. Backend Changes:
   - Create new backend service
   - Add currency conversion rate field to country table
   - Move machine rate calculations to backend
   - Add endpoints for:
     - Fetching machine rates with currency conversion
     - Updating machine rates
     - Creating new machine rates
     - Deleting machine rates

2. Frontend Changes:
   - Update machine rate component for currency conversion
   - Modify API calls to include currency conversion
   - Update UI to show currency symbols
   - Move hardcoded values to country table

## Next Steps
1. Create backend service
2. Update database schema
3. Implement currency conversion
4. Move calculations to backend
5. Update frontend components
